At this project, I'm trying to create a template with **Clean** structure and come up with a reusable, nice and scalable structure for any backend project and ofcourse reusable codes and completely separate packages. In this template project we try to imagine different scenarios and test everything for open source community.

If you do love to contribute, please do, we appreciate it.

And ofcourse don't forget to read [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file to know about how to contribute in this project.
