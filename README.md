# Learning Golang Language In Clean Structure

At this example project, I'm trying to learn **Golang** with **Clean** structure and come up with a reusable, nice and scalable structure for any other project of mine and everyone else and ofcourse reusable codes and packages. Just right after this example project passes all the tests and scenarios and all items of this list down here are marked as done, i create a repository and make a free open-source template out of it for usage of me and everyone else.

If you do love to contribute, please do, I appreciate it.

And ofcourse don't forget to read [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file to know about how to contribute in this project.
